# Introduction

- Extract common charts based on our business and package them into components. Based on Vue and echarts encapsulation, the x-echarts chart component can easily generate common charts by providing a simple configuration item that is friendly to both front-end and back-end data formats.

- When we do business, we can refer to it. If we cannot find the corresponding configuration, we can also refer to the official Echarts documentation. [echarts document](https://echarts.apache.org/en/api.html)

## Features
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Standardized Data Format

  Using a unified ECharts data format ensures that both the front-end and back-end can understand and use this data. This avoids inconsistencies in data formats and transmission methods, reducing the likelihood of errors.

  The component can simultaneously support Vue 2 and Vue 3. This means that you can use the same chart component to support both old and new Vue projects without any additional modifications or adaptations.

- üí° Configurable and Easy to Use

  The component provides some default configurations internally while allowing users to customize them according to their needs, thus meeting various visual and functional requirements.

- üõ†Ô∏è Easy to Maintain and Extend

  With the show-option options configuration, you can easily view ECharts configuration options and extend the functionality of the ECharts component.
