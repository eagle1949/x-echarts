- Extract common charts based on our business and package them into components. Based on Vue and echarts encapsulation, the x-echarts chart component can easily generate common charts by providing a simple configuration item that is friendly to both front-end and back-end data formats.

- When we do business, we can refer to it. If we cannot find the corresponding configuration, we can also refer to the official Echarts documentation. [echarts document](https://echarts.apache.org/en/api.html)
